In debug more when running CPU and then PPU and stopping, the palette RAM is not initialized

Allow user to select palette and then re-draw the pattern tables with the selected palette.
Maybe use radio buttons?

When selecting in debugger nametable 0 the location (7, 16) it should look like 'A' character in NES TEST, but instead
it is 'Z' character.


NES TEST: Debugger: Nametable: Selecting location (0, 14) is fine, but then going to next row, and it selects at location (0, 16)
why does it jump by 2 in the rows?
